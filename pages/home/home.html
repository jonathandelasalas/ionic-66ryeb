    What is a Calories Burned Calculator?
  </h1>
  <p text-justify>
Find out how many calories you burn doing different activities. This calculator uses the Metabolic
Equivalent of Task (METs) to calculate calories burned, giving a personalized result. Knowing
roughly how many calories you expend doing different activities can help you with weight loss or
maintenance.

    What is the connection between METs and Calories?
  </h6>
  <p text-justify>
    If you know the MET value of a particular activity, you can figure out how many calories youâ€™re
burning.
The formula to use is:
METs x 3.5 x (your body weight in kilograms) / 200 = calories burned per minute.
For example, say you weigh 73 kg. and you singles tennis, which has a MET value of 8.
The formula would work as follows:
8 x 3.5 x 73 / 200 = 10.22 calories per minute.
If you play tennis for an hour, you will burn about 613.20 calories.
